# SignApp Trainer

## Set up

First, create a virtual environment AFTER cloning and `cd`ing into the project's directory, then source into it:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

After sourcing into the virtual environment, install `pip-tools`:

```sh
pip install pip-tools
```

Finally, install the dependencies

```sh
pip-sync
```

After that, you're ready to run SignApp by executing `main.py`.
